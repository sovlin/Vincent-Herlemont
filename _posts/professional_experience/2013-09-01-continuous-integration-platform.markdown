### Problematic

The company Imagina-international needs to rework the development process.

**Currently  :**

- Itâ€™s a ERP written in java, this is a large application ( 1,5 Million lines )
- Any continuous integration 
- Any automating test
- Any libraries manager

### My mission

Make a study for the point presented before ( continuous integration, automating test, libraries manager ).
  All the technologies have to match with the current code of ERP application. 
  Moreover,  **impact on a developer practices** needs to be taken into consideration.

### Study & Compare

- Maven ( Now Gradle was more efficient ! )
- TeamCity
- Sonar
- Nexus
- Ngtest
- Seleniumhq

For each technology :

- Documentation and comparison with similar technologies.
- Setting up of new management processes for the development team.
- Install and deploy all the continuous integration.
